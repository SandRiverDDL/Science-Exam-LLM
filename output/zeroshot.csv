In the central part of Switzerland, uplift took place along a ductile north–south normal faultzone called the Rhône-Simplon line. The structure thus formed is called the Lepontin dome.
Intrusions
In older rocks from the lower crust intrusions are found that formed during or just after the Hercynian orogeny. ","On the southern margins of the European continent shallow seas formed limestone deposits, that would later be (in the Alps) incorporated into the Helvetic nappes. At the same time sedimentation of anoxic clay took place in the deep-marine realms of the Piemont-Liguria and Valais Oceans. This clay would later become the Bündner slates from the Penninic nappes.
Paleocene and Eocene
","In Switzerland the Molasse Basin is rimmed to the northwest by the Jura mountains, an external fold-and-thrust belt, which can be seen as part of the Alps geologically. The western part of the Molasse basin forms the plateau of the Mittelland between the Alps and Jura Mountains. The Jura Mountains' location is still a topic for debate. A possible tectonic factor is the north–south extensional Upper Rhine Graben to the north.

A trophic cascade can occur in a food web if a trophic level in the web is suppressed.
For example, a top-down cascade can occur if predators are effective enough in predation to reduce the abundance, or alter the behavior, of their prey, thereby releasing the next lower trophic level from predation. A top-down cascade is a trophic cascade where the top consumer/predator controls the primary consumer population","Next in the chain is an organism that feeds on the primary producer, and the chain continues in this way as a string of successive predators. The organisms in each chain are grouped into trophic levels, based on how many links they are removed from the primary producers. The length of the chain, or trophic level, is a measure of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from plants to top predators. Food energy flows from one organism to the next and to the next and so on, with some energy being lost at each level. ","At a given trophic level there may be one species or a group of species with the same predators and prey.
In 1927, Charles Elton published an influential synthesis on the use of food webs, which resulted in them becoming a central concept in ecology. In 1966, interest in food webs increased after Robert Paine's experimental and descriptive study of intertidal shores, suggesting that food web complexity was key to maintaining species diversity and ecological stability.

A peer-reviewed commentary by 58 scholars involved in the scientific study of consciousness rejects these conclusions about logic gates as ""mysterious and unfalsifiable claims"" that should be distinguished from ""empirically productive hypotheses"". IIT as a scientific theory of consciousness has been criticized in the scientific literature as only able to be ""either false or unscientific"" by its own definitions. ","To solve this problem, Daniel Toker and Friedrich T. Sommer have shown that the spectral decomposition of the correlation matrix of a system's dynamics is a quick and robust proxy for the Minimum Information Partition.

While the algorithm for assessing a system's and conceptual structure is relatively straightforward, its high time complexity makes it computationally intractable for many systems of interest. Heuristics and approximations can sometimes be used to provide ballpark estimates of a complex system's integrated information, but precise calculations are often impossible. ","The maximally irreducible cause-effect repertoire of each concept within a conceptual structure specifies what the concept contributes to the quality of the experience, while its irreducibility specifies how much the concept is present in the experience.
According to IIT, an experience is thus an intrinsic property of a complex of mechanisms in a state.
Extensions 
The calculation of even a modestly-sized system's is often computationally intractable, so efforts have been made to develop heuristic or proxy measures of integrated information. "

A few of the many important textures are presented here as examples.
Graphic, micrographic texture, and granophyric textures are examples of intergrowths formed during magmatic crystallization. They are angular intergrowths of quartz and alkali feldspar. When well-developed, the intergrowths may resemble ancient cuneiform writing, hence the name. ","Rock microstructure includes the texture of a rock and the small-scale rock structures. The words texture and microstructure are interchangeable, with the latter preferred in modern geological literature. However, texture is still acceptable because it is a useful means of identifying the origin of rocks, how they formed, and their appearance.
Textures are penetrative fabrics of rocks; they occur throughout the entirety of the rock mass on a microscopic, hand-specimen, and often outcrop scale. This is similar in many ways to foliations, except a texture does not necessarily carry structural information in terms of deformation events and orientation information. ","This is especially vital for describing phenocrysts and fragmental textures of tuffs, as often relationships between magma and phenocryst morphology are critical for analysing cooling, fractional crystallization and emplacement.
Analysis of intrusive rock microstructures can provide information on source and genesis, including contamination of igneous rocks by wall rocks and identifying crystals which may have been accumulated or dropped out of the melt. This is especially critical for komatiite lavas and ultramafic intrusive rocks.

What is the origin of most green pigments in the arts?,"Green pigments are derived from organic materials, such as plants and leaves.",Green pigments are produced through a complex process involving multiple natural elements.,Green pigments are synthesized chemically in laboratories and factories.,Green pigments are a result of combining various colors through a blending technique.,Green pigments are mined from minerals containing copper compounds.,E,C,"Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. ","Only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced, by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad, and then yellow with Reseda luteola, also known as yellow-weed.
The pigments available to painters were more varied; monks in monasteries used verdigris, made by soaking copper in fermenting wine, to color medieval manuscripts. They also used finely-ground malachite, which made a luminous green. They used green earth colors for backgrounds.
","During the early Renaissance, painters such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned to paint faces first with a green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.
Modern history
In the 18th and 19th century 
The 18th and 19th centuries brought the discovery and production of synthetic green pigments and dyes, which rapidly replaced the earlier mineral and vegetable pigments and dyes. "

United States Armed Forces
The United States military have expressed interest in pursuing research in electric gun technology throughout the late 20th century, since electromagnetic guns don't require propellants to fire a shot as conventional gun systems do, significantly increasing crew safety and reducing logistics costs, as well as provide a greater range. ","In a March 2014 statement to the Intelligence, Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, Chief of Naval Research Admiral Matthew Klunder stated, ""Barrel life has increased from tens of shots to over 400, with a program path to achieve 1000 shots."" However, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) will not confirm that the 400 shots are full-power shots. ","It was the first time in history that such levels of performance were reached.

Which of the following statements accurately describes the characteristics of Hypsoropha moths based on the provided Wikipedia excerpt?,Hypsoropha moths belong to the family Noctuidae. The genus was erected by Jacob Hübner in 1818.,Hypsoropha moths are known for their distinct colorful patterns on their wings. The genus was erected by Jacob Hübner in 1818.,Hypsoropha moths are a nocturnal species found predominantly in North America. The genus was erected by Jacob Hübner in 1818.,Hypsoropha moths are classified as a genus of moths in the family Erebidae. The genus was erected by Jacob Hübner in 1818.,"Hypsoropha moths are known for their exceptional size, with wingspans reaching up to 10 inches. The genus was erected by Jacob Hübner in 1818.",D,A,"This type of industrial melanism has only affected such moths as obtain protection from insect-eating birds by resting on trees where they are concealed by an accurate resemblance to their background (over 100 species of moth in Britain with melanic forms were known by 1980). No species which hide during the day, for instance, among dead leaves, is affected, nor has the melanic change been observed among butterflies.
This is, as shown in many textbooks, ""evolution in action"".
Much of the early work was done by Bernard Kettlewell, whose methods came under scrutiny later on. ","Starting in 2000, Majerus conducted a detailed seven-year study of moths, experimenting to assess the various criticisms. He concluded that differential bird predation was a major factor responsible for the decline in carbonaria frequency compared to typica in Cambridge during the study period, and described his results as a complete vindication of the peppered moth story. He said, ""If the rise and fall of the peppered moth is one of the most visually impacting and easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action, it should be taught. It provides after all the proof of evolution.""
","Although the moths are cryptically camouflaged and rest during the day in unexposed positions on trees, they are predated by birds hunting by sight. The original camouflage (or crypsis) seems near-perfect against a background of lichen growing on trees. The sudden growth of industrial pollution in the nineteenth century changed the effectiveness of the moths' camouflage: the trees became blackened by soot, and the lichen died off. In 1848 a dark version of this moth was found in the Manchester area. "
What is the relationship between the Cauchy momentum equation and the Navier-Stokes equation?,"The Navier-Stokes equation can be derived from the Cauchy momentum equation by specifying the stress tensor through a constitutive relation, expressing the shear tensor in terms of viscosity and fluid velocity, and assuming constant density and viscosity.",The Navier-Stokes equation is a simplified version of the Cauchy momentum equation that only applies to situations with constant density and viscosity.,"The Navier-Stokes equation is a special case of the Cauchy momentum equation, which is a more general equation that applies to all non-relativistic momentum conservation situations.",The Cauchy momentum equation and the Navier-Stokes equation are completely unrelated and cannot be used interchangeably in any situation.,"The Cauchy momentum equation is a special case of the Navier-Stokes equation, which is a more general equation that applies to all non-relativistic momentum conservation situations.",A,C,"In fluid dynamics, the Euler equations are a set of quasilinear hyperbolic equations governing adiabatic and inviscid flow. They are named after Leonhard Euler. The equations represent Cauchy equations of conservation of mass (continuity), and balance of momentum and energy, and can be seen as particular Navier–Stokes equations with zero viscosity and zero thermal conductivity. In fact, Euler equations can be obtained by linearization of some more precise continuity equations like Navier–Stokes equations in a local equilibrium state given by a Maxwellian. ","These two solutions have infinite energy; they blow up everywhere in space in finite time.

What is the fate of a carbocation formed in crystalline naphthalene?,"The carbocation remains positively charged, trapped in the solid.","The carbocation undergoes spontaneous bond breaking, yielding a carbon-helium ion.","The carbocation forms a bond with helium, becoming a stable compound.","The carbocation undergoes decay, forming a negatively charged ion.","The carbocation gains an electron from surrounding molecules, becoming an electrically neutral radical.",E,A,"However, it is more stable than a typical ""secondary"" carbocation, being roughly as stable as a tertiary carbocation like t-butyl cation, according to hydride ion affinity.
The existence of non-classical carbocations was once the subject of great controversy. On opposing sides were Herbert C. ","This ion is predicted to be aromatic by Hückel's rule.
In 1902, Norris and Kehrman independently discovered that colorless triphenylmethanol gives deep-yellow solutions in concentrated sulfuric acid. Triphenylmethyl chloride similarly formed orange complexes with aluminium and tin chlorides. In 1902, Adolf von Baeyer recognized the salt-like character of the compounds formed. Trityl carbocation (shown below) as a stable carbocationic system has been used as homogeneous organocatalyst in organic synthesis.
","The chemical establishment was reluctant to accept the notion of a carbocation and for a long time the Journal of the American Chemical Society refused articles that mentioned them.
The first NMR spectrum of a stable carbocation in solution was published by Doering et al. in 1958. It was the heptamethylbenzenium ion, made by treating hexamethylbenzene with methyl chloride and aluminium chloride. The stable 7-norbornadienyl cation was prepared by Story et al. "

In which team does Dennis Sveum currently play for as an ice hockey player?,Norwegian national team,Trondheim Black Panthers,Stavanger Oilers,No team at the moment,Bergen Tigers,C,D,"Most goaltenders nowadays choose to catch with their non-dominant hand.
Field hockey players are forced to play right-handed. The rules of the game denote that the ball can only be struck with the flat side of the stick. Only one player Laeeq Ahmed on Pakistan National Hockey team, played with unorthodox left hand below and right hand up side of stick grip with full command. He played from 1991 to 1992 for the national team. Perhaps to avoid confusing referees, there are no left-handed sticks. ","Gordie Howe was one of few players capable of doing both, although this was at a time when the blade of the stick was not curved.
Another ice hockey goaltender Bill Durnan, had the ability to catch the puck with either hand. He won the Vezina Trophy, then for the National Hockey League's goalie with the fewest goals allowed six times out of only seven seasons. He had developed this ability playing for church-league teams in Toronto and Montreal to make up for his poor lateral movement. He wore custom gloves that permitted him to hold his stick with either hand. ","In floorball, like ice hockey, right-handed players shoot left and, likewise, most left-handed players shoot right as the player will often wield the stick one-handed. Floorball goalkeepers do not use a stick, so they have two glove hands, and act much like a soccer goalkeeper, but with an ice hockey helmet. When they venture out of the goal box, they act just like an outfield soccer player.

Newton's statements on Fatio's theory differed widely. For example, after describing the necessary conditions for a mechanical explanation of gravity, he wrote in an (unpublished) note in his own printed copy of the Principia in 1692:The unique hypothesis by which gravity can be explained is however of this kind, and was first devised by the most ingenious geometer Mr. N. Fatio. ","On the other hand, Fatio himself stated that although Newton had commented privately that Fatio's theory was the best possible mechanical explanation of gravity, he also acknowledged that Newton tended to believe that the true explanation of gravitation was not mechanical. Also, Gregory noted in his ""Memoranda"": ""Mr. Newton and Mr. Halley laugh at Mr. Fatio's manner of explaining gravity."" This was allegedly noted by him on December 28, 1691. ","In 1756 for the first time one of his expositions of the theory was published, and in 1758 he sent a more detailed exposition, Essai de Chymie Méchanique, to a competition to the Academy of Sciences in Rouen.

They typically reply that the number of births in the hospital makes no difference to the likelihood of more than 60% male babies in one day. The explanation in terms of the heuristic is that people consider only how representative the figure of 60% is of the previously given average of 50%.
Dilution effect
Richard E. Nisbett and colleagues suggest that representativeness explains the dilution effect, in which irrelevant information weakens the effect of a stereotype. ","They had to say whether a given quantity was larger or smaller than that number. For instance, they might be asked, ""Is the percentage of African countries which are members of the United Nations larger or smaller than 65%?"" They then tried to guess the true percentage. Their answers correlated well with the arbitrary number they had been given. Insufficient adjustment from an anchor is not the only explanation for this effect. An alternative theory is that people form their estimates on evidence which is selectively brought to mind by the anchor.
","The words were selected to activate the concept either of hostility or of kindness: a process known as priming. They then had to interpret the behavior of a man described in a short, ambiguous story. Their interpretation was biased towards the emotion they had been primed with: the more priming, the greater the effect. A greater interval between the initial task and the judgment decreased the effect.
Tversky and Kahneman offered the availability heuristic as an explanation for illusory correlations in which people wrongly judge two events to be associated with each other. "

","As a result of the increased demand and tightening restrictions on exports of the metals from China, some countries are stockpiling rare-earth resources. Searches for alternative sources in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, Tanzania, Greenland, and the United States are ongoing. Mines in these countries were closed when China undercut world prices in the 1990s, and it will take a few years to restart production as there are many barriers to entry. One example is the Mountain Pass mine in California, which announced its resumption of operations on a start-up basis on August 27, 2012. ","In 2013, it was stated that the demand for REEs would increase due to the dependence of the EU on these elements, the fact that rare earth elements cannot be substituted by other elements and that REEs have a low recycling rate. Furthermore, due to the increased demand and low supply, future prices are expected to increase and there is a chance that countries other than China will open REE mines. REE is increasing in demand due to the fact that they are essential for new and innovative technology that is being created. "

With the Stefan–Boltzmann law, astronomers can easily infer the radii of stars. The law is also met in the thermodynamics of black holes in so-called Hawking radiation.
Effective temperature of the Earth 
","The Stefan–Boltzmann law describes the power radiated from a black body in terms of its temperature. Specifically, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body across all wavelengths per unit time (also known as the black-body radiant emittance) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's thermodynamic temperature T:
The constant of proportionality σ, called the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, is derived from other known physical constants. ","As of the 2019 redefinition of SI base units, which fixes the values of the Boltzmann constant k, the Planck constant h, and the speed of light c, the Stefan–Boltzmann constant is exactly

What is the relevant type of coherence for the Young's double-slit interferometer?,Visibility,Coherence time,Spatial coherence,Coherence length,Diameter of the coherence area (Ac),E,C,"if it is interpreted as something that has the potentiality to manifest as a particle or wave, but during its time in flight is neither, then there is no time paradox. This is the standard view, and recent experiments have supported it.
Introduction
In the basic double-slit experiment, a beam of light (usually from a laser) is directed perpendicularly towards a wall pierced by two parallel slit apertures. ","Recombining the beams results in interference phenomena at detection screens positioned just beyond each exit port. What issues to the right side displays reinforcement, and what issues toward the top displays cancellation. It is important to keep in mind however that the illustrated interferometer effects apply only to a single photon in a pure state. When dealing with a pair of entangled photons, the photon encountering the interferometer will be in a mixed state, and there will be no visible interference pattern without coincidence counting to select appropriate subsets of the data.
Delayed choice
","However, when they looked at the signal photons whose entangled idlers were detected at D3 or D4, they detected simple diffraction patterns with no interference.
Significance
This result is similar to that of the double-slit experiment, since interference is observed when it is not known from which slit the photon originates, while no interference is observed when the path is known.

What is the primary characteristic of anagrammatic poetry?,Each line is an anagram of all other lines.,Each verse is an anagram of all other verses.,Each word within each line is an anagram.,Each stanza is an anagram of all other stanzas.,The poem is an anagram of a famous literary work.,B,C,"But on the other hand, it happens that the luck of the letters makes things bad. This is the case with the weird anagram ""Santa / Satan"", as it is with a rotational ambigram that has gone viral because of the paradoxical and unintentional message it expresses. Spotted in 2015 on a metal medal marketed without bad intention, the text ""hope"" displays upside down with a fairly obvious reading ""Adolf"", first name of the Nazi leader situated at the antipodes of optimism. This coincidence photographed by an Internet user was relayed by several media and constitutes an ambiguous image.
Mathematics
","In Wordplay: The Philosophy, Art, and Science of Ambigrams, John Langdon mentions the yin and yang symbol as one of his major influences to create upside down words.
Ambigrams are mentioned in Metamagical Themas, an eclectic collection of articles that Douglas Hofstadter wrote for the popular science magazine Scientific American during the early 1980s.
Cognition and psychology
Legibility is certainly one of the most important aspects in successful ambigrams. It concerns the ease with which a reader decodes symbols. If the message is lost or difficult to perceive, an ambigram does not work. ","As a result, it begins to produce several ambigrammatic visuals, staged in photographic contexts, where sentences such as ""I'm fine"", ""I feel fantastic"" or ""Life is great"" turn into ""Save me"", ""I'm falling apart"", and ""I hate myself"". Readers intrigued by this logo placed at the upper left corner of the page with an upside-down typographical catchphrase rotate the newspaper to decipher, and immediately visualize the double calligraphed messages, which call out with the SOS.

What is the term used to describe the geological structure that Bonny Hills is built upon?,Erosion,Tectonic plate,Karst,Fault,Alluvium,E,D,"Clearly, this region was exposed to a very long period of erosion in the very distant past which beveled the original mountainous surface to a gently undulating surface. The present surface is not much different. Hills rise just a few hundred feet above the surrounding countryside. The highest of these, such as Rib Hill, Wisconsin, are made up mostly of resistant quartzite or granite.
The structure of Superior Upland rock is quite complex. Folds and faults, most dating back to Precambrian time, record several episodes of mountain-building. ","Mountain building thrust up the Rocky Mountains to the north and east and tremendous, earth-stretching tension created the Basin and Range Province to the west and south.
Although the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau may seem to have little in common, their geological stories are intimately intertwined. In the early part of this Era (Paleogene Period), both regions had low elevations of probably less than 1 kilometer. Geologists are still gathering evidence and debating what came next.
","Sediment collects in the adjacent valleys, in some places burying the bedrock under thousands of feet of rock debris.
Clarence Dutton famously compared the many narrow parallel mountain ranges that distinguish the unique topography of the Basin and Range to an ""army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico"", which is a helpful way to visualize the overall appearance of the region. The Basin and Range province should not be confused with The Great Basin, which is a sub-section of the greater Basin and Range physiographic region defined by its unique hydrological characteristics (internal drainage).

Pentecostalism 
Classical Pentecostalism does not have set days of abstinence and lent, but individuals in the movement may feel they are being directed by the Holy Spirit to undertake either short or extended fasts. Although Pentecostalism has not classified different types of fasting, certain writers within the movement have done so. Arthur Wallis writes about the ""Normal Fast"" in which pure water alone is consumed. ","Although seemingly against the Middle Way, this practice is to experience the negative karma of both oneself and all other sentient beings and, as such is seen to be of benefit.

Fasting is a practice in several Christian denominations and is done both collectively during certain seasons of the liturgical calendar, or individually as a believer feels led by the Holy Spirit; many Christians also fast before receiving Holy Communion (this is known as the Eucharistic Fast).

What is the decay energy for the free neutron decay process?,0.013343 MeV,0.013 MeV,"1,000 MeV",0.782 MeV,0.782343 MeV,E,D,"The daughter nucleus that results is usually left in an excited state and it can decay to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma ray photon.
In neutron emission, extremely neutron-rich nuclei, formed due to other types of decay or after many successive neutron captures, occasionally lose energy by way of neutron emission, resulting in a change from one isotope to another of the same element.
In electron capture, the nucleus may capture an orbiting electron, causing a proton to convert into a neutron in a process called electron capture. A neutrino and a gamma ray are subsequently emitted.
","The excited energy states resulting from these decays which fail to end in a ground energy state, also produce later internal conversion and gamma decay in almost 0.5% of the time.
More common in heavy nuclides is competition between alpha and beta decay. The daughter nuclides will then normally decay through beta or alpha, respectively, to end up in the same place.
Radioactive decay results in a reduction of summed rest mass, once the released energy (the disintegration energy) has escaped in some way. ","Radioactive decay (also known as nuclear decay, radioactivity, radioactive disintegration, or nuclear disintegration) is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive. Three of the most common types of decay are alpha decay (), beta decay (), and gamma decay (), all of which involve emitting one or more particles. The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, while the other two are governed by the electromagnetic and strong forces.
Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e. random) process at the level of single atoms. "

Some prefer the terms PTIR or PTMS to AFM-IR as the technique is not necessarily restricted to infrared wavelengths. The amplitude of the cantilever oscillation is directly related to the amount of infrared radiation absorbed by the sample. By measuring the cantilever oscillation amplitude as a function of wavenumber, Dazzi's group was able to obtain absorption spectra from nanoscale regions of the sample. ","the first infrared spectrum obtained in this way was reported by Hammiche et al. in 2004: this represented the first proof that spectral information about a sample could be obtained using this approach.
Both of these early experiments used a broadband source in conjunction with an interferometer; these techniques could, therefore, be referred to as AFM-FTIR although Hammiche et al. coined the more general term photothermal microspectroscopy or PTMS in their first paper. PTMS has various subgroups; ","The original technique dubbed AFM-IR that induced resonant motion in the probe using a Free Electron Laser has developed by exploiting the foregoing permutations so that it has evolved into various forms.
The pioneering experiments of Hammiche et al and Anderson had limited spatial resolution due to thermal diffusion - the spreading of heat away from the region where the infrared light was absorbed. The thermal diffusion length (the distance the heat spreads) is inversely proportional to the root of the modulation frequency. "

Specifically, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body across all wavelengths per unit time (also known as the black-body radiant emittance) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's thermodynamic temperature T:

Carr's essay was widely discussed in the media both critically and in passing. ","In the essay, Carr introduces the discussion of the scientific support for the idea that the brain's neural circuitry can be rewired with an example in which philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is said to have been influenced by technology. According to German scholar Friedrich A. Kittler in his book Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, Nietzsche's writing style became more aphoristic after he started using a typewriter. Nietzsche began using a Malling-Hansen Writing Ball because of his failing eyesight which had disabled his ability to write by hand. "

Who was the first person to describe the pulmonary circulation system?,Galen,Avicenna,Hippocrates,Aristotle,Ibn al-Nafis,E,C,"1509 - 1553 CE), Arab physician Ibn al-Nafis (1213 - 1288 CE), and Syrian physician Qusta ibn Luqa. Several figures such as Hippocrates and al-Nafis receive credit for accurately predicting or developing specific elements of the modern model of pulmonary circulation: Hippocrates for being the first to describe pulmonary circulation as a discrete system separable from systemic circulation as a whole and al-Nafis for making great strides over the understanding of those before him and towards a rigorous model. ","Pulmonary circulation is archaically known as ""lesser circulation."" However, this term is still used in non-English literature.
The discovery of pulmonary circulation has been attributed to many esteemed scientists with credit distributed in varying ratios by varying sources. In much of modern medical literature, the discovery is credited to English physician William Harvey (1578 - 1657 CE) based on the comprehensive completeness and correctness of his model, despite its relative recency. Other sources credit Greek philosopher Hippocrates (460 - 370 BCE), Spanish physician Michael Servetus (c. ","Finally, in 1628, the influential British physician William Harvey (1578 – 1657 AD) provided at the time the most complete and accurate description of pulmonary circulation of any scholar worldwide in his treatise Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus. At the macroscopic level, his model is still recognizable in and reconcilable with modern understandings of pulmonary circulation.

Several literary critics have noted the influence of phrenology (and physiognomy) in Edgar Allan Poe's fiction.
The character of Calvin Candie (portrayed by Leonardo di Caprio) claims to be a practitioner of phrenology in the movie Django Unchained.
The character of U.S. Army Major Doctor Augustus Bendix from AMC's western Hell on Wheels is an avid practitioner of phrenology.
","Because of the lack of scientific support, along with religious and prejudicial reasons, phrenology never found a wide audience in Ireland.

The first publication in the United States in support of phrenology was published by Dr. John Bell, who reissued Combe's essays with an introductory discourse, in 1822. The following year, Dr. John G. Wells of Bowdoin College ""commenced an annual exposition, and recommendation of its doctrines, to his class"". In 1834, Dr. John D.

This kind of mimicry probably evolved as a response to the presence of ants.
Mantises
While praying mantises are carnivorous insects, they also are in danger of being eaten by larger animals. ","Several species of Micropezidae (stilt-legged flies) resemble ants (especially the wingless, haltere-less Badisis ambulans), as do species in the genus Syringogaster, which ""strikingly"" resemble Pseudomyrmex and are hard even for experts to distinguish ""until they take flight"".
Beetles
Many parasitic Staphylinidae that march with army ants strikingly resemble their hosts. An outstanding example is Ecitomorpha nevermanni, whose color varies to match the color variation of its host Eciton burchellii. ","In Lasioglossum leucozonium, the Dufour's Gland mostly contains octadecanolide as well as some eicosanolide. There is also evidence of n-triscosane, n-heptacosane, and 22-docosanolide. However, the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction.

Cynomorium
Many names have been published in Cynomorium, but there are probably only two species. It is not closely related to anything else, so it is placed in the monogeneric family Cynomoriaceae.
Attempts to find its closest relatives have demonstrated with special clarity that molecular phylogenetics is not a sure-fire, problem-free method of determining systematic relationships. One study placed it in Saxifragales, but not at any particular position within that order. ","Doubts have been expressed about the results of this study. Another study placed Cynomorium in Rosales based on analysis of the two invert repeat regions of the chloroplast genome, which evolve at one fifth the rate of the two single copy regions.
Gumillea
Gumillea has a single species, Gumillea auriculata, and is known from only one specimen which was collected in the late 18th century in Peru. It was named by Hipólito Ruiz López and José Antonio Pavón Jiménez.

","A form of microtone known as the blue note is an integral part of rock music and one of its predecessors, the blues. The blue notes, located on the third, fifth, and seventh notes of a diatonic major scale, are flattened by a variable microtone. Joe Monzo has made a microtonal analysis of the song ""Drunken Hearted Man"", written and recorded by the delta blues musician Robert Johnson.
","Secondly the octave, the most fundamental of all intervals, is postulated to be pure (beatless), as described by the frequency ratio 2:1.""
Terminology
Microtone 
Microtonal music can refer to any music containing microtones. The words ""microtone"" and ""microtonal"" were coined before 1912 by Maud MacCarthy Mann in order to avoid the misnomer ""quarter tone"" when speaking of the srutis of Indian music. "

Star Carrier: Earth Strike (2010), novel by William H. Keith, Jr. writing as Ian Douglas. ","The author's vividly kaleidoscopic descriptions of Armsedge, and the fateful banquet set-piece where the assassin runs amok, are instances of recurring themes in Delany's work: the quest (here, to decode and disarm Babel-17), a damaged protagonist (Wong), and an economical use of colorful detail to flesh out the social background of his stories (the remarkable Armsedge itself). ","A journalist who is an outspoken sceptic on the possibility of time dilation accidentally goes on a subjective 10-year voyage to Sheliak, and discovers that the phenomenon is real indeed.
Moon Pilot (1962), film written by Maurice Tombragel based on the novel Starfire by Robert Buckner, and directed by James Neilson.

What is the reason for the sun appearing slightly yellowish when viewed from Earth?,The sun appears yellowish due to a reflection of the Earth's atmosphere.,"The longer wavelengths of light, such as red and yellow, are not scattered away and are directly visible when looking towards the sun.","The sun appears yellowish due to the scattering of all colors of light, mainly blue and green, in the Earth's atmosphere.","The sun emits a yellow light due to its own spectrum, which is visible when viewed from Earth.","The atmosphere absorbs the shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and red, leaving only the longer wavelengths of light, such as green and yellow, visible when looking towards the sun.",B,C,"3), when viewed from space or when the Sun is high in the sky. The Solar radiance per wavelength peaks in the green portion of the spectrum when viewed from space. When the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; the reasons for this are the subject of debate.
","it is today known that this is due to the movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.
One of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. He reasoned that it was not the chariot of Helios, but instead a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the land of the Peloponnesus and that the Moon reflected the light of the Sun. ","During sunrise and sunset, sunlight is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere, and the Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.
An optical phenomenon, known as a green flash, can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. "

What is the Roche limit?,The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to rotate since the forces exerted by two massive bodies produce a torque on a third object.,The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to unite since differential force from a planet results in parts becoming attracted to one another.,The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause a planet to disintegrate since differential force from an object overcomes the planet's core.,The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to disintegrate since differential force from a planet overcomes the attraction of the parts between them.,"The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to break apart due to differential force from the planet overcoming the attraction of the parts of the object for one another, which depends on the object's density and composition, as well as the mass and size of the planet.",D,E,"Roche limit, Hill sphere and radius of the planet 
Consider a planet with a density of and a radius of , orbiting a star withis is the physical meaning of Roche limit, Roche lobe and Hill sphere.
Formula(2) (link?) can be described as: , a perfect mathematical symmetry.
This is the astronomical significance of Roche limit and Hill sphere.
Note : Roche limit and Hill sphere are completely different from each other but are both work of Édouard Roche.
","The term is named after Édouard Roche (, ), who was the French astronomer who first calculated this theoretical limit in 1848.
Explanation 
The Roche limit typically applies to a satellite's disintegrating due to tidal forces induced by its primary, the body around which it orbits. Parts of the satellite that are closer to the primary are attracted more strongly by gravity from the primary than parts that are farther away; ","These bodies are well outside their Roche limits by various factors, from 21 for the Moon (over its fluid-body Roche limit) as part of the Earth–Moon system, upwards to hundreds for Earth and Jupiter.
The table below gives each satellite's closest approach in its orbit divided by its own Roche limit. Again, both rigid and fluid body calculations are given. Note that Pan, Cordelia and Naiad, in particular, may be quite close to their actual break-up points.
In practice, the densities of most of the inner satellites of giant planets are not known. "

What is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and how does it relate to angular momentum in quantum mechanics?,"The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the axis of rotation of a quantum particle is undefined, and that quantum particles possess a type of non-orbital angular momentum called ""spin"". This is because angular momentum, like other quantities in quantum mechanics, is expressed as a tensorial operator in relativistic quantum mechanics.","The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the total angular momentum of a system of particles is equal to the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and that the centre of mass is for the system. This is because angular momentum, like other quantities in quantum mechanics, is expressed as an operator with quantized eigenvalues.","The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the total angular momentum of a system of particles is subject to quantization, and that the individual particle angular momenta are expressed as operators. This is because angular momentum, like other quantities in quantum mechanics, is subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.","The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the axis of rotation of a quantum particle is undefined, and that at any given time, only one projection of angular momentum can be measured with definite precision, while the other two remain uncertain. This is because angular momentum, like other quantities in quantum mechanics, is subject to quantization and expressed as an operator with quantized eigenvalues.","The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that at any given time, only one projection of angular momentum can be measured with definite precision, while the other two remain uncertain. This is because angular momentum, like other quantities in quantum mechanics, is expressed as an operator with quantized eigenvalues.",E,D,"The Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that when two complementary measurements are made, there is a limit to the product of their accuracy. As an example, if one measures the position with an accuracy of and the momentum with an accuracy of , then 
In de Broglie–Bohm theory, there is always a matter of fact about the position and momentum of a particle. Each particle has a well-defined trajectory, as well as a wavefunction. Observers have limited knowledge as to what this trajectory is (and thus of the position and momentum). ","As in classical mechanics, successive observations of the particles' positions refine the experimenter's knowledge of the particles' initial conditions. Thus, with succeeding observations, the initial conditions become more and more restricted. This formalism is consistent with the normal use of the Schrödinger equation.
For the derivation of the uncertainty relation, see Heisenberg uncertainty principle, noting that this article describes the principle from the viewpoint of the Copenhagen interpretation.
Quantum entanglement, Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox, Bell's theorem, and nonlocality 
","It is the lack of knowledge of the particle's trajectory that accounts for the uncertainty relation. What one can know about a particle at any given time is described by the wavefunction. Since the uncertainty relation can be derived from the wavefunction in other interpretations of quantum mechanics, it can be likewise derived (in the epistemic sense mentioned above) on the de Broglie–Bohm theory.
To put the statement differently, the particles' positions are only known statistically. "

What happens to excess base metal as a solution cools from the upper transformation temperature towards an insoluble state?,"The excess base metal will often solidify, becoming the proeutectoid until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.","The excess base metal will often crystallize-out, becoming the proeutectoid until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.","The excess base metal will often dissolve, becoming the proeutectoid until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.","The excess base metal will often liquefy, becoming the proeutectoid until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.","The excess base metal will often evaporate, becoming the proeutectoid until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.",B,A,"Although the elements of an alloy usually must be soluble in the liquid state, they may not always be soluble in the solid state. If the metals remain soluble when solid, the alloy forms a solid solution, becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals, called a phase. If as the mixture cools the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous microstructure of different phases, some with more of one constituent than the other. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. ","While the high strength of steel results when diffusion and precipitation is prevented (forming martensite), most heat-treatable alloys are precipitation hardening alloys, that depend on the diffusion of alloying elements to achieve their strength. When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, but then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming intermetallic phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. ","By adding chromium to steel, its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced, creating stainless steel, while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics, producing silicon steel.
Like oil and water, a molten metal may not always mix with another element. For example, pure iron is almost completely insoluble with copper. Even when the constituents are soluble, each will usually have a saturation point, beyond which no more of the constituent can be added. Iron, for example, can hold a maximum of 6.67% carbon. "

The channel has a U-like shape in its starting region, which is consistent with its formation during a giant flood. The sector of the Zanclean channel that passes through the Camarinal Sill may have a different origin, however.
","such flow rates are about a thousand times larger than the discharge of the Amazon River and ten times as much as the Missoula Floods.

They further indicate the formation of large gyres in the Alboran Sea during the flooding and that the flood eroded the Camarinal Sill at a rate of . ","The exact size of the flood is dependent on the pre-flood water levels in the Mediterranean and higher water levels there would result in a much smaller flood.
The flood affected only the Western Mediterranean at first, because the Sicily Sill (located at the present Straits of Sicily) formed a barrier separating its basin from the Eastern Mediterranean basin that probably overflowed through the Noto Canyon across the Malta Escarpment; in addition a sill may have existed in the eastern Alboran Sea at this time.

In the 1960s, promoter George Garabedian of Mark 56 Records created a ""Magic Record"" which would randomly play a tune by Arthur Lyman, The Marathons' novelty song ""Peanut Butter,"" or an imitation Tijuana Brass number. ","Side 3 played from the inside out and side 5 was on a 7-inch single. The side consisted of one recorded groove in the center of the record and was a perfectly timed loop of the music of a non-album song called ""All the Shit U Do.""
An example of a live album with a locked groove is Eagles Live: The applause at the end of side 4 would continue into the locked groove, rather than fading out like on the other sides.

Brian Arthur, two economists, introduced and elaborated the concept of path dependence, the idea that past events and decisions affect present options and that some outcomes can persist due to the operation of a self-reinforcing feedback loop. ","Douglass North, an economist and Nobel laureate, applied the idea of path dependence to institutions, which he defined as ""the rules of the game in a society,"" and drew attention to the persistence of institutions.
A synthesis
Political scientists Ruth Berins Collier and David Collier, in Shaping the Political Arena (1991), provided a synthesis of many ideas introduced from the 1960s to 1990, in the form of the following ""five-step template"":
Antecedent Conditions ––> Cleavage or Shock ––> Critical Juncture 
","(5) ""The legacy is an enduring, self-reinforcing institutional inheritance of the critical juncture that stays in place and is stable for a considerable period.""
Debates in the 2000s–2010s
Following a period of consolidation of critical junctures framework, few new developments occurred in the 1990s. However, since around 2000, several new ideas were proposed and many aspects of the critical junctures framework are the subject of debate.

Gea eff Levi, 1983 – family Araneidae. An orb-weaver spider from New Guinea. It was given its unusual specific name because, even after it was identified as a distinct species, it remained for years without a proper description and was referred to in several papers simply as Argiope ""F"".
","and the specific epithet solo refers to the fact that the species is the youngest Diplagnostidae fossil found to that date, suggesting that it was the last surviving member of that family.

The Long Now Foundation, which (in their words) ""seeks to promote 'slower/better' thinking and to foster creativity in the framework of the next 10,000 years"", has a policy of anticipating the Year 10,000 problem by writing all years with five digits.

This included the recommendation that the COBOL picture clause should be used to specify four digit years for dates.
In the 1980s, the brokerage industry began to address this issue, mostly because of bonds with maturity dates beyond the year 2000. By 1987 the New York Stock Exchange had reportedly spent over $20 million, including ""a team of 100"" programmers on Y2K.

A further Poor Law Amendment Act was passed in 1844; ","a document recommending infanticide and alleged to be the work of the Poor Law Commission was published as the Book of Murder.
Relationship to Chartism
The ease with which the Reform Parliament had passed the Poor Law Act of 1834, its refusal to pass a Ten-Hour Bill and the contrast between the zeal with which the New Poor Law was brought in and the failure to enforce the Factory Act of 1833 were powerful arguments that only the fundamental political changes sought by Chartism would produce a Parliament which paid more than lip-service to the interests of the working classes. ","Of all subjects of legislation on which Governments ought not harshly or prematurely to interfere, without ascertaining, and, if possible, carrying with them the prevailing sentiments of the country, this of the Poor Law appears to me the one on which it would be most undesirable to take a precipitate course.""

What is the term used to describe the area of the city of Coulter that was determined by the population count at the 2020 census?,Municipality,Census tract,City limit ,Urban district,Metropolitan area,C,B,"for example, if the population density of the United Kingdom is 250 people per square kilometer, then it would be reasonable to estimate (in the absence of any other data) that the most likely (if not actually correct) density of each of the five constituent countries is also 250/km2. Traditionally in cartography, the predominant conceptual model for this kind of phenomenon has been the statistical surface, in which the variable is imagined as a third-dimension ""height"" above the two-dimensional space that varies continuously. ","In Geographic information science, the more common conceptualization is the field, adopted from Physics and usually modeled as a scalar function of location. Choropleth maps are better suited to intensive variables than extensive; if a map user sees the United Kingdom filled with a color for ""100-200 people per square km,"" estimating that Wales and England may each have 100-200 people per square km may not be accurate, but it is possible and a reasonable estimate.
Normalization 
","However, while it is possible to map an extensive variable in a choropleth map, this is almost universally discouraged because patterns can be easily misinterpreted. For example, if a choropleth map assigned a particular shade of red to total populations between 60 and 70 million, a situation in which United Kingdom (as a single district) has 65 million inhabitants would be indistinguishable from a situation in which the four constituent countries each had 65 million inhabitants, even though these are vastly different geographic realities.

Landscape ecology
Systems ecology","This habitat is very challenging to research, and as well as being little-studied, it is vast, with 79% of the Earth's biosphere being at depths greater than . With no plant life, the animals in this zone are either detritivores, reliant on food drifting down from surface layers, or they are predators, feeding on each other. Some organisms are pelagic, swimming or drifting in mid-ocean, while others are benthic, living on or near the seabed. ","The large blue butterfly Phengaris arion is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.
Disturbance is important in the creation of biodiverse habitat types. In the absence of disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. "

What is the required excess quark per billion quark-antiquark pairs in the early universe in order to provide all the observed matter in the universe?,One,Five,Three,Two,Four,A,D,"Free quarks probably existed in the extreme conditions of the very early universe until about 30 microseconds after the Big Bang, in a very hot gas of free quarks, antiquarks and gluons. This gas is called quark–gluon plasma (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge (color charge) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different vacuum state, in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can; ","Equilibrium of strangeness in quark–gluon plasma 
One cannot assume that under all conditions the yield of strange quarks is in thermal equilibrium. In general, the quark-flavor composition of the plasma varies during its ultra short lifetime as new flavors of quarks such as strangeness are cooked up inside. The up and down quarks from which normal matter is made are easily produced as quark-antiquark pairs in the hot fireball because they have small masses. ","On the other hand, the next lightest quark flavor—strange quarks—will reach its high quark–gluon plasma thermal abundance provided that there is enough time and that the temperature is high enough. This work elaborated the kinetic theory of strangness production proposed by T. Biro and J. Zimanyi who demonstrated that strange quarks could not be produced fast enough alone by quark-antiquark reactions. A new mechanism operational alone in QGP was proposed.

Absorption
As noted in the historical section, a major problem for every Le Sage model is the energy and heat issue. ","If those particles have no internal energy modes, the excess energy can only be absorbed by ordinary matter. Addressing this problem, Armand Jean Leray proposed a particle model (perfectly similar to Le Sage's) in which he asserted that the absorbed energy is used by the bodies to produce magnetism and heat.

What is the evidence for the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy?,"The Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center because of the bright flare activity observed near Sagittarius A*. The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S2 would collide with it. Observations of the star S14 indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. No known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain 4.0 million M☉ in this volume of space.","The Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center because the star S14 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter of 17 light-hours from the center of the central object. From the motion of star S14, the object's mass can be estimated as 4.0 million M☉, or about 7.96×1036 kg.

Some galaxies lack any supermassive black holes in their centers. Although most galaxies with no supermassive black holes are very small, dwarf galaxies, one discovery remains mysterious: The supergiant elliptical cD galaxy A2261-BCG has not been found to contain an active supermassive black hole, despite the galaxy being one of the largest galaxies known; ","A supermassive black hole (SMBH or sometimes SBH) is the largest type of black hole, with its mass being on the order of millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun (). Black holes are a class of astronomical objects that have undergone gravitational collapse, leaving behind spheroidal regions of space from which nothing can escape, not even light. Observational evidence indicates that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. For example, the Milky Way has a supermassive black hole in its Galactic Center, corresponding to Sagittarius A*. ","Even these would evaporate over a timescale of up to 10106 years.

In opposition to this raft metaphor, Moritz Schlick (1959; original 1932) argued for a view of scientific knowledge akin to the pyramid image in which knowledge rests on a special class of statements whose verification doesn't depend on other belief","As suggested in 1620 by Francis Bacon, developed by Saint-Simon, and promulgated in the 1830s by his former student Comte, positivism was the first modern philosophy of science. Human knowledge had evolved from religion to metaphysics to science, explained Comte, which had flowed from mathematics to astronomy to physics to chemistry to biology to sociology—in that order—describing increasingly intricate domains, all of society's knowledge having become scientific, whereas questions of theology and of metaphysics remained unanswerable, Comte argued.

P. E. ","Nopcsa proposed a model for the extinction of the dinosaurs similar to Matthew's but with greater emphasis on the implications the uplifted terrain had for the plants they depended on. He also suggested that competition from mammals that arrived in North America from Asia played a role.
N. M. Jakolev proposed that the dinosaur went extinct because Earth's climate became too cold to sustain them.
1923
Roy Lee Moodie proposed that dinosaurs were killed off by diseases. ","Nevertheless, so few dinosaurs were known that the significance of their passing went unrecognized and little scientific effort was exerted toward finding an explanation. As more and more different kinds of dinosaurs were discovered, their extinction and replacement by mammals was recognized as significant but dismissed with little examination as a natural consequence of the mammals' supposed innate superiority. Consequently, paleontologist Michael J. Benton has called the years up to 1920 as the ""Nonquestion Phase"" of Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction research.

What is the role of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model?,The Higgs boson is responsible for giving mass to the photon and gluon in the Standard Model.,The Higgs boson has no role in the Standard Model.,The Higgs boson is responsible for giving mass to all the elementary particles in the Standard Model.,"The Higgs boson is responsible for giving mass to all the elementary particles, except the photon and gluon, in the Standard Model.",The Higgs boson is responsible for giving mass to all the composite particles in the Standard Model.,D,C,"The existence of the Higgs field became the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics, and for several decades was considered ""the central problem in particle physics"".
The hypothesised Higgs theory made several key predictions. One crucial prediction was that a matching particle, called the ""Higgs boson"", should also exist. Proving the existence of the Higgs boson would prove whether the Higgs field existed, and therefore finally prove whether the Standard Model's explanation was correct. ","Physicist Matt Strassler highlighted ""considerable"" evidence that the new particle is not a pseudoscalar negative parity particle (consistent with this required finding for a Higgs boson), ""evaporation"" or lack of increased significance for previous hints of non-Standard Model findings, expected Standard Model interactions with W and Z bosons, absence of ""significant new implications"" for or against supersymmetry, and in general no significant deviations to date from the results expected of a Standard Model Higgs boson. However some kinds of extensions to the Standard Model would also show very similar results; ","The importance of the Higgs boson is largely that it is able to be examined using existing knowledge and experimental technology, as a way to confirm and study the entire Higgs field theory. Conversely, proof that the Higgs field and boson do not exist would have also been significant.
Particle physics
Validation of the Standard Model 
The Higgs boson validates the Standard Model through the mechanism of mass generation. As more precise measurements of its properties are made, more advanced extensions may be suggested or excluded. As experimental means to measure the field's behaviours and interactions are developed, this fundamental field may be better understood. "

The luminous point-like cores of quasars were the first ""high-redshift"" () objects discovered before the improvement of telescopes allowed for the discovery of other high-redshift galaxies.
","Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.
Gravitational interactions of galaxies with each other and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the universe. ","For galaxies more distant than the Local Group and the nearby Virgo Cluster, but within a thousand megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and has come to be known as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. "

This is evidence for both the metacognitive perspective as well as the psycholinguistic perspective. It demonstrates the devotion of resources to searching memory, a source of cumulative information, for the desired correct information, and it also shows that we are aware of what information we know or do not know. ","they had no motivation to provide accurate responses and were forced to respond even when they were unsure of the answer. Another study done by Hill RD, Storandt M, and Simeone C tested the impact of memory skills training and external reward on free recall of serial word lists. Effects similar to those reported in the previous study were seen in children—in contrast to older learners.
Interference
In the absence of interference, there are two factors at play when recalling a list of items: the recency and the primacy effects. ","However, Rock's work did not settle the controversy because in his experiment he rearranged replaced word pairs that could be either easier or harder to learn than the original words in the word- digit pair. In further experiments that addressed the question, there were mixed results. The incremental learning hypothesis is supported by the notion that awhile after Ai-Bi pairs are learned, the recall time to recall Bi decreases with continued learning trails.
Another theory that can be tested using cued recall is symmetry of forward and backward recall. Forward recall is generally assumed to be easier than backward recall, i.e. "

Also some test theories of special relativity use some sort of Lorentzian framework. For instance, the Robertson–Mansouri–Sexl test theory introduces a preferred aether frame and includes parameters indicating different combinations of length and times changes. ","However, the logical consistency of special relativity (as well as its empirical success) is well established, so the views of such individuals are considered unfounded within the mainstream scientific community.
John Stewart Bell advocated teaching special relativity first from the viewpoint of a single Lorentz inertial frame, then showing that Poincare invariance of the laws of physics such as Maxwell's equations is equivalent to the frame-changing arguments often used in teaching special relativity. ","This would imply that all forces of nature (not just electromagnetism) must be invariant under the Lorentz transformation. In 1921 Lorentz credited Poincaré for establishing the principle and postulate of relativity and wrote: ""I have not established the principle of relativity as rigorously and universally true. Poincaré, on the other hand, has obtained a perfect invariance of the electro-magnetic equations, and he has formulated 'the postulate of relativity', terms which he was the first to employ.""

The water cycle in the Columbia River is dependent on the relation between water flow and topography in the basin. Within the United States, only the Missouri-Mississippi River system has annual runoff greater than that of the Columbia River. The amount of water that the river carries each year is determined by the precipitation, sunlight, and air temperature in the basin, which varies from year to year. ","This gradient in nitrogen distribution is partly a result of the inputs of the Columbia's major tributaries, the Snake River and the Willamette River. The Snake and Willamette rivers together contribute about 50-80 percent of the nitrogen load in a given year, coming from activities within those respective watersheds.
Weathering and runoff 
Weathering is the break down of rocks, soil, and minerals through contact with water, the atmosphere, and biological organisms, converting solid phase minerals to dissolved phase compounds. ","West of the Cascade Range, most of the winter precipitation falls as rain, but in the Cascade Mountains and eastward, precipitation through winter is snow. Snowmelt in the mountains begins to reach the river during early to mid-spring. About 30 percent of the streamflow in the Columbia River occurs between January and March (primarily from rainfall) and about 30 percent occurs between April and June (from a combination of rainfall and snowmelt).

For positive energies – i.e.","The symmetry for the inverse-square central force is higher and more subtle. The peculiar symmetry of the Kepler problem results in the conservation of both the angular momentum vector L and the LRL vector A (as defined above) and, quantum mechanically, ensures that the energy levels of hydrogen do not depend on the angular momentum quantum numbers l and m.

The LRL vector A is a constant of motion of the Kepler problem, and is useful in describing astronomical orbits, such as the motion of planets and binary stars. Nevertheless, it has never been well-known among physicists, possibly because it is less intuitive than momentum and angular momentum. "

The study of quantum turbulence aims to explore two main questions:
Are vortex tangles really random, or do they contain some characteristic properties or organised structures ?
How does quantum turbulence compare with classical turbulence?
To understand quantum turbulence it is useful to make connection with the turbulence of classical fluids. The turbulence of classical fluids is an everyday phenomenon, which can be readily observed in the flow of a stream or river as was first done by Leonardo da Vinci in his famous sketches. ","From Fig 10, it can be seen that for small length scales the turbulence follows the typical behaviour of an isolated vortex. As a result of these properties Vinen turbulence appears as an almost completely random flow with a very weak or negligible energy cascade.
Decay of quantum turbulence 
Stemming from the different signatures, Kolmogorov and Vinen turbulence follow power laws relating to their temporal decay. ","Low temperature quantum turbulence should thus consist of a double cascade: a Kolmogorov regime (a cascade of eddies) in the inertial range , followed by a bottle-neck plateau, followed by the Kelvin wave cascade (a cascade of waves) that obeys the same law but with different physical origin. This is at current consensus, but it must be stressed that it arises from theory and numerical simulations only: there is currently no direct experimental evidence for the Kelvin wave cascade due to the difficulty of observing and measuring at such small length scales.

","The power would be delivered by a then-unidentified pulsed power source he referred to, using bomb terminology, the ""primary"".
The main advantage to this scheme is the efficiency of the fusion process at high densities. According to the Lawson criterion, the amount of energy needed to heat the D-T fuel to break-even conditions at ambient pressure is perhaps 100 times greater than the energy needed to compress it to a pressure that would deliver the same rate of fusion. So, in theory, the ICF approach could offer dramatically more gain. ","The direct-drive approach still may not be less expensive to operate.
Nuclear weapons program
The very hot and dense conditions encountered during an ICF experiment are similar to those created in a thermonuclear weapon, and have applications to nuclear weapons programs. ICF experiments might be used, for example, to help determine how warhead performance will degrade as it ages, or as part of a program of designing new weapons. Retaining knowledge and expertise inside the nuclear weapons program is another motivation for pursuing ICF. "

The natural landscape shapes the flow of the rivers and determines their meeting point.,"The angle at which the Colliding Rivers meet is mainly caused by the man-made alterations made to the rivers' course and the construction of dams. These alterations redirect the flow of the rivers, leading to their specific meeting angle.","The angle at which the Colliding Rivers meet is mainly caused by the seasonal variations in water flow and the changing volume of the rivers. During specific times of the year, the rivers' flow patterns create the unique intersection angle.",A,C,"The curvature varies from a maximum at the apex to zero at a crossing point (straight line), also called an inflection, because the curvature changes direction in that vicinity. The radius of the loop is the straight line perpendicular to the down-valley axis intersecting the sinuous axis at the apex. As the loop is not ideal, additional information is needed to characterize it. The orientation angle is the angle between sinuous axis and down-valley axis at any point on the sinuous axis.
A loop at the apex has an outer or concave bank and an inner or convex bank. ","They are predictable obstacles that instigate meander formation by deflecting the stream. For example, the stream might be guided into a fault line (morphotectonic).

Cut bank 
A cut bank is an often vertical bank or cliff that forms where the outside, concave bank of a meander cuts into the floodplain or valley wall of a river or stream. A cutbank is also known either as a river-cut cliff, river cliff, or a bluff and spelled as cutbank. ","In a speech before the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1926, Albert Einstein suggested that because the Coriolis force of the earth can cause a small imbalance in velocity distribution, such that velocity on one bank is higher than on the other, it could trigger the erosion on one bank and deposition of sediment on the other that produces meanders However, Coriolis forces are likely insignificant compared with other forces acting to produce river meanders.
Meander geometry
The technical description of a meandering watercourse is termed meander geometry or meander planform geometry. It is characterized as an irregular waveform. "

Who was the first to determine the velocity of a star moving away from the Earth using the Doppler effect?,Fraunhofer,William Huggins,Hippolyte Fizeau,Vogel and Scheiner,None of the above,B,E,"This is roughly 8 times the effect of annual aberration, as one would expect since the velocity of the Solar System relative to the center of the Galaxy is about 8 times the velocity of the Earth relative to the Sun.
Discovery and first observations
The discovery of the aberration of light was totally unexpected, and it was only by considerable perseverance and perspicacity that Bradley was able to explain it in 1727. It originated from attempts to discover whether stars possessed appreciable parallaxes.
Search for stellar parallax
","Thus, the speed of light to the speed of the Earth's annual motion in its orbit is 10,210 to one, from whence it would follow, that light moves, or is propagated as far as from the Sun to the Earth in 8 minutes 12 seconds.
The discovery and elucidation of aberration is now regarded as a classic case of the application of scientific method, in which observations are made to test a theory, but unexpected results are sometimes obtained that in turn lead to new discoveries. ","The velocity of the aether outside of the Earth would decrease as a function of distance from the Earth so light rays from stars would be progressively dragged as they approached the surface of the Earth. The Earth's motion would be unaffected by the aether due to D'Alembert's paradox.
Both Fresnel and Stokes' theories were popular. However, the question of aberration was put aside during much of the second half of the 19th century as focus of inquiry turned to the electromagnetic properties of aether.

This configuration improves fuel efficiency and emissions. As a further advantage, running a Wankel engine at a constant speed gives greater engine life. Keeping to a near constant, or narrow band, of revolutions eliminates, or vastly reduces, many of the disadvantages of the Wankel engine.
","The Wankel engine has the advantages of compact design and low weight over the more common internal combustion engine, which uses reciprocating pistons. These advantages give rotary engine applications in a variety of vehicles and devices, including automobiles, motorcycles, racing cars, aircraft, go-karts, jet skis, snowmobiles, chainsaws, and auxiliary power units. Certain Wankel engines have a power-to-weight ratio over one horsepower per pound. Most engines of the design are of spark ignition, with compression ignition engines having been built only in research projects.
","There have been a number of concept cars incorporating a series hybrid powertrain arrangement. A Wankel engine used only as a generator has packaging, noise, vibration and weight distribution advantages when used in a vehicle, maximizing interior passenger and luggage space. The engine/generator may be at one end of the vehicle with the electric driving motors at the other, connected only by thin cables.

Which proteins are encoded by the ARPP19 gene in humans?,cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19 and protein kinase C,cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19 and phosphoprotein phosphatase 1B,cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19 and protein kinase B,cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19 and protein kinase G,cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19 and protein kinase A,B,A,"ARMH3 or Armadillo Like Helical Domain Containing 3, also known as UPF0668 and c10orf76, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ARMH3 gene. Its function is not currently known, but experimental evidence has suggested that it may be involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein contains a conserved proline-rich motif, suggesting that it may participate in protein-protein interactions via an SH3-binding domain, although no such interactions have been experimentally verified. The well-conserved gene appears to have emerged in Fungi approximately 1.","2 billion years ago. The locus is alternatively spliced and predicted to yield five protein variants, three of which contain a protein domain of unknown function, DUF1741.
Function 
It has been found to contain a potential SH3-binding domain, which is known to participate in protein-protein binding interactions; however, no protein interactions have been experimentally verified with c10orf76. ","The human ARMH3 locus is flanked on the left and right sides by HPS6 and KCNIP2, respectively. HPS6 is a protein that may play a role in organelle biogenesis, and KCNIP2 is a voltage-gated potassium channel interacting protein. The same pattern is observed in the orthologous locus in mice, as well as most other vertebrates.
Expression 
The NCBI (GenBank) gene profile for c10orf76 labels the start of the first transcribed exon as the beginning of the gene. "

The circular definition ""object: a thing"" → ""thing: an entity"" → ""entity: an object"" has a depth of three.
","the answer is that the objection requires prior analysis of the terms in order to identify identical parts, yet the terms themselves cannot be reduced to these parts: the meaning of ""musicality"" is composed of the meaning of ""musical"" and the meaning of ""ity"", the meaning of ""musical"" is composed of the meaning of ""music"" and ""al"".

Formal approaches to characterizing circular definitions are found in logic, mathematics and in computer science.

To someone who does not know which trees are oaks, nor which nuts are acorns, the definition is inadequate.

Renormalization group 
Renormalization concepts, especially the renormalization group methods in quantum theories and statistical mechanics, have a long history and a very broad scope. The concepts of renormalization that appear useful in theories quantized in the front form of dynamics are essentially of two types, as in other areas of theoretical physics. The two types of concepts are associated with two types of theoretical tasks involved in applications of a theory. ","What is the required set of parameters ?
The renormalization group concept associated with the first question predates the concept associated with the second question. Certainly, if one were in possession of a good answer to the second question, the first question could also be answered. In the absence of a good answer to the second question, one may wonder why any specific choice of parameters and their cutoff dependence could secure cutoff independence of all observables with finite scales .
The renormalization group concept associated with the first question above relies on the circumstance that some finite set yields the desired result,
","The renormalization group concept associated with the second question above is conceived to explain how it may be so that the concept of renormalization group associated with the first question can make sense, instead of being at best a successful recipe to deal with divergences in perturbative calculations.

Engineers are working to derive technologies developed for the DDG-1000 series ships into a battery system so other warships can operate a railgun. As of 2014 most destroyers can spare only nine megawatts of additional electricity, while it would require 25 megawatts to propel a projectile to the desired maximum range (i.e.","In 1944, during World War II, Joachim Hänsler of Germany's Ordnance Office proposed the first theoretically viable railgun.

Athletes started both races from a crouched start (4 point stance). In both the original Olympics and the modern Olympics, only men were allowed to participate in track and field until the 1928 games in Amsterdam, Netherlands. ","In athletics and track and field, sprints (or dashes) are races over short distances. They are among the oldest running competitions, being recorded at the Ancient Olympic Games. Three sprints are currently held at the modern Summer Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres.
At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before driving forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. The set position differs depending on the start. ","The 1928 games were the also the first games to use a 400-meter track, which became the standard for track and field.
The modern sprinting events have their roots in races of imperial measurements which were later altered to metric: the 100 m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200 m distance came from the furlong (or mile), and the 400 m was the successor to the 440-yard dash or quarter-mile race.

World War I marked the airship's real debut as a weapon. The Germans, French and Italians all used airships for scouting and tactical bombing roles early in the war, and all learned that the airship was too vulnerable for operations over the front. ","The decision to end operations in direct support of armies was made by all in 1917.
Many in the German military believed they had found the ideal weapon with which to counteract British naval superiority and strike at Britain itself, while more realistic airship advocates believed the zeppelin's value was as a long range scout/attack craft for naval operations. Raids on England began in January 1915 and peaked in 1916: following losses to the British defenses only a few raids were made in 1917–18, the last in August 1918.

Savant memory varies among different savants. Similar to DeBlois and Paravicini, an autistic savant named Leslie Lemke has displayed extraordinary musical talent. Lemke lacks the capacity for abstract reasoning, but he has several abilities that coincide with his exceptional memory. ","Instead, without a single exception, all winners consider themselves mnemonists (see below) and rely on using mnemonic strategies, mostly the method of loci.
Cases 
Cases of eidetic memory have been reported for generations, with a 1970 study on a woman being called the most convincing documentation yet. Her memory was extraordinary in that she could see an image once and retain it in memory for years to come. The classic study of the subject's memory documents her writing out poetry in a foreign language, of which she had no prior knowledge, years after seeing the original text. ","This suggests that her memory retained the image of the foreign words vividly enough to recall years later. Reports also suggest that her memory was so vivid that she could obscure other parts of the present visual field with these past memories.
However, this subject remains the only person to have passed such a test, and the credibility of the findings are highly questionable, given that the researcher married his subject, and the tests have never been repeated. The study fueled strong skepticism about studies of eidetic memory for several decades thereafter. "

Technical discussion of spacetime
Geometry of spacetime
Comparison between flat Euclidean space and Minkowski space
Special relativity uses a 'flat' 4-dimensional Minkowski space – an example of a spacetime. Minkowski spacetime appears to be very similar to the standard 3-dimensional Euclidean space, but there is a crucial difference with respect to time.
In 3D space, the differential of distance (line element) ds is defined by
where are the differentials of the three spatial dimensions. ","(The point in the lower left of the Fig. 10-2 represents the star, the origin represents the observer, and the line represents the null geodesic ""line of sight"".)
The cone in the −t region is the information that the point is 'receiving', while the cone in the +t section is the information that the point is 'sending'.
The geometry of Minkowski space can be depicted using Minkowski diagrams, which are useful also in understanding many of the thought experiments in special relativity.
","The primed coordinates of and are related to the unprimed coordinates through the Lorentz transformations and could be approximately measured from the graph (assuming that it has been plotted accurately enough), but the real merit of a Minkowski diagram is its granting us a geometric view of the scenario. For example, in this figure, we observe that the two timelike-separated events that had different x-coordinates in the unprimed frame are now at the same position in space.

(Morland 1981)
Morland eventually concluded that the ""secret"" was that the primary and secondary were kept separate and that radiation pressure from the primary compressed the secondary before igniting it. ",""" In 1978, Morland had decided that discovering and exposing the ""last remaining secret"" would focus attention onto the arms race and allow citizens to feel empowered to question official statements on the importance of nuclear weapons and nuclear secrecy. Most of Morland's ideas about how the weapon worked were compiled from highly-accessible sources, the drawings that most inspired his approach came from the Encyclopedia Americana. ","The exact amount of contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to what became known as the ""Teller–Ulam design"" is not definitively known in the public domain—the degree of credit assigned to Teller by his contemporaries is almost exactly commensurate with how well they thought of Teller in general. In an interview with Scientific American from 1999, Teller told the reporter:
I contributed; Ulam did not. I'm sorry I had to answer it in this abrupt way. Ulam was rightly dissatisfied with an old approach. "

Therefore, if the diffracting object is smaller, the resulting diffraction pattern will be narrower.","The angular spacing of features in the diffraction pattern is independent of the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. Therefore, if the diffracting object is smaller, the resulting diffraction pattern will be the same as if it were big.","The angular spacing of features in the diffraction pattern is inversely proportional to the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. Therefore, if the diffracting object is smaller, the resulting diffraction pattern will be wider.","The angular spacing of features in the diffraction pattern is directly proportional to the square root of the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. Therefore, if the diffracting object is smaller, the resulting diffraction pattern will be slightly narrower.",D,B," The distance between spots, and the details of contrast within one single spot, depend on the distance between sample and film; this distance is therefore an important degree of freedom for white-beam topography experiments.
Deformation of the crystal will cause variation in the size of the diffraction spot."," These channels transmit intensity only in specific, parallel directions, and thus guarantee a one-to-one-relation between detector pixels and points on the sample surface, which would otherwise not be given in the case of materials with high strain and/or a strong mosaicity. The spatial resolution of the method is limited by a combination of detector pixel size and channel plate periodicity, which in the ideal case are identical. The angular resolution is mostly given by the aspect ratio (length over width) of the MCP channels.

Tanner, Brian: X-ray diffraction topography.","The cross section of the diffracted beam may or may not be identical to the one of the incident beam. In the case of strongly asymmetric reflections, the beam size (in the diffraction plane) is considerably expanded or compressed, with expansion occurring if the incidence angle is much smaller than the exit angle, and vice versa. Independently of this beam expansion, the relation of sample size to image size is given by the exit angle alone: The apparent lateral size of sample features parallel to the exit surface is downscaled in the image by the projection effect of the exit angle.

What is the typical variety of food used in an organized food fight?,The food weapons used are primarily fruits and vegetables.,The food weapons used are usually a mixture of different kinds of food.,The food weapons used are primarily meat and dairy products.,"The food weapons used are any food within reach, regardless of the variety.","The food weapons used are usually all of one kind, or of a limited variety.",E,B,"The international Food and Agriculture Organization's Codex Alimentarius does not recognize the term ""natural"" but does have a standard for organic foods.
Negative-calorie food 
A negative-calorie food is food that supposedly requires more food energy to be digested than the food provides. Its thermic effect or specific dynamic action – the caloric ""cost"" of digesting the food – would be greater than its food energy content. Despite its recurring popularity in dieting guides, there is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that any food is calorically negative. ","At the simplest level this may involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients, such as spices. It may also involve mixing, heating or cooling, pressure cooking, fermentation, or combination with other food. In a home, most food preparation takes place in a kitchen. Some preparation is done to enhance the taste or aesthetic appeal; other preparation may help to preserve the food; others may be involved in cultural identity. A meal is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place.
Animal preparation
","According to Goode, Curtis and Theophano, food ""is the last aspect of an ethnic culture to be lost"".
Many cultures have a recognizable cuisine, a specific set of cooking traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture, which evolves over time. Other differences include preferences (hot or cold, spicy, etc.) and practices, the study of which is known as gastronomy. Many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation, cooking methods, and manufacturing. This also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food, not just by consumption.

Farmers still look after the apple trees in an old-fashioned way: slowly, organically and sustainably.
Climate 
The temperature, amount of precipitation, sunshine duration and soil pH can all influence the growth and quality of apples in a place. It directly changes the sweetness and acidity of cider syrup. ","Hence, one year's cider syrup is never like the next year's. Otherwise, farmers sometimes have to purchase superior apples for cider and cider syrup from another orchard.
Processing
In Colonial America
The instruction of making the cider syrup was required to put fresh juice into an open, irresponsive metal container and skimmed as it boils down. The volume should be concentrated to approximate the one-seventh of the original. Hence, the apple cider syrup is very difficult and expensive to make. ","It also has a dark colour and caramelised sweetness, which is specially balanced by sharp acidity that the result of the good sugar and acid balance found in most North American dessert.
Characteristics 
The apple cider syrup is a thick, dark brown syrup. The cider syrup is a translucent syrup with a tangy bite. No extra food additives or sugar is added in to the apple cider syrup. It tastes more tart than maple syrup. Therefore, the cider syrup has lower risks of developing diabetes than other syrup when people excessive consumption.

The first measurement of the expansion of space came with Hubble's realization of the velocity vs. redshift relation. Most recently, by comparing the apparent brightness of distant standard candles to the redshift of their host galaxies, the expansion rate of the universe has been measured to be H0 = . ","Yet before this evidence, many rejected the Milne viewpoint based on the mediocrity principle.
More direct results of the expansion, such as change of redshift, distance, flux, angular position and the angular size of astronomical objects, have not been detected yet due to smallness of these effects. Change of the redshift or the flux could be observed by Square Kilometre Array or Extremely Large Telescope in the mid-2030s.

Eddington, Arthur. ","Using the redshift of their electromagnetic spectra to determine the distance and speed of remote objects in space, he showed that all objects are moving away from us, and that their speed is proportional to their distance, a feature of metric expansion. Further studies have since shown the expansion to be highly isotropic and homogeneous, that is, it does not seem to have a special point as a ""center"", but appears universal and independent of any fixed central point.

Overview
Two different methods of applying this leaky bucket analogy are described in the literature. These give what appear to be two different algorithms, both of which are referred to as the leaky bucket algorithm and generally without reference to the other method. This has resulted in confusion about what the leaky bucket algorithm is and what its properties are.
In one version of applying the analogy, the analogue of the bucket is a counter or variable, separate from the flow of traffic or scheduling of events. ","to levels below the levels set for Usage/Network Parameter Control in the network to prevent it taking action to further limit that connection. The leaky bucket algorithm is also used in leaky bucket counters, e.g. to detect when the average or peak rate of random or stochastic events or stochastic processes, such as faults or failures, exceed defined limits.
At least some implementations of the leaky bucket are a mirror image of the Token Bucket algorithm and will, given equivalent parameters, determine exactly the same sequence of events to conform or not conform to the same limits. ","In describing the operation of the ITU-T's version of the algorithm, McDysan and Spohn invoke a ""notion commonly employed in queueing theory of a fictional 'gremlin'"". This gremlin inspects the level in the bucket and takes action if the level is above the limit value τ : in policing (figure 2), it pulls open a trap door, which causes the arriving packet to be dropped and stops its water from entering the bucket; "
"What is the ""ultraviolet catastrophe""?",It is a phenomenon that occurs only in multi-mode vibration.,It is the misbehavior of a formula for higher frequencies.,It is the standing wave of a string in harmonic resonance.,It is a flaw in classical physics that results in the misallocation of energy.,It is a disproven theory about the distribution of electromagnetic radiation.,B,D,"He argued that Maxwell's heat problem might be avoided by assuming that the absorbed energy is not converted into heat, but re-radiated in a still more penetrating form. He noted that this process possibly can explain where the energy of radioactive substances comes from – however, he stated that an internal cause of radioactivity is more probable. In 1911 Thomson went back to this subject in his article ""Matter"" in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition. ","Lyman Spitzer in 1941 calculated, that absorption of radiation between two dust particles lead to a net attractive force which varies proportional to 1/r2 (evidently he was unaware of Le Sage's shadow mechanism and especially Lorentz's considerations on radiation pressure and gravity). George Gamow, who called this effect ""mock gravity"", proposed in 1949 that after the Big Bang the temperature of electrons dropped faster than the temperature of background radiation. ","The suggestion of a secondary re-radiation mechanism for wave models attracted the interest of JJ Thomson, but was not taken very seriously by either Maxwell or Poincaré, because it entails a gross violation of the second law of thermodynamics (huge amounts of energy spontaneously being converted from a colder to a hotter form), which is one of the most solidly established of all physical laws.
The energy problem has also been considered in relation to the idea of mass accretion in connection with the Expanding Earth theory. "

Perhaps further research into the cultural and institutional aspects of inter-war cryptology in Japan could uncover those reasons.
Conclusions 
Several curious facts stand out in this cursory overview of Japanese cryptological history. One is that the Japanese government did not bring in an outside expert to help with their codes until 1924. Considering all the other gaikokujin oyatoi (hired foreigners) brought in to assist with ""modernization"" in the Meiji period, it is striking that such an important field as cryptology would be ignore","s.
The Polish cipher expert, Jan Kowalefsky, might not have helped improve Japanese codes before the Washington Naval Conference but he did have a strong influence on Japanese cryptography between the conference and World War II. He trained what seems to be the first generation of professional Japanese cryptographers.
Jan Kowalewski 
Japanese authors have identified two events that influenced the Japanese army's decision to invite a foreigner to improve their cryptology.
The first was an incident during the Siberian Interventio","e. Thus, probably the most widely read English books on cryptological history are possibly missing a large and important part of the development of professional cryptology in Japan – if the Japanese sources are correct. If the Japanese sources for this history can be confirmed, it would be an important addition to the understanding of Japanese cryptology leading up to World War II. Polish cryptanalysts were very good and if they tutored the Japanese for almost fifteen years, it makes the Japanese failure to break most of the Allied codes during the war much more puzzlin"
What is the propagation constant in sinusoidal waves?,The propagation constant is a measure of the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave that varies with distance.,The propagation constant is a real number that remains constant with distance due to the phase change in the sinusoidal wave.,The propagation constant is a real number that varies with distance due to the phase change in the sinusoidal wave.,The propagation constant is a complex number that varies with distance due to the phase change in the sinusoidal wave.,The propagation constant is a complex number that remains constant with distance due to the phase change in the sinusoidal wave.,D,C,"The sinusoid is defined for all times and distances, whereas in physical situations we usually deal with waves that exist for a limited span in space and duration in time. An arbitrary wave shape can be decomposed into an infinite set of sinusoidal waves by the use of Fourier analysis. As a result, the simple case of a single sinusoidal wave can be applied to more general cases. In particular, many media are linear, or nearly so, so the calculation of arbitrary wave behavior can be found by adding up responses to individual sinusoidal waves using the superposition principle to find the solution for a general waveform. ","Mathematically, the simplest wave is a sinusoidal plane wave in which at any point the field experiences simple harmonic motion at one frequency. In linear media, complicated waves can generally be decomposed as the sum of many sinusoidal plane waves having different directions of propagation and/or different frequencies. A plane wave is classified as a transverse wave if the field disturbance at each point is described by a vector perpendicular to the direction of propagation (also the direction of energy transfer); or longitudinal if those vectors are exactly in the propagation direction. Mechanical waves include both transverse and longitudinal waves; ","Halfway between two nodes there is an antinode, where the two counter-propagating waves enhance each other maximally. There is no net propagation of energy over time.
Physical properties 
Waves exhibit common behaviors under a number of standard situations, for example:
Transmission and media 
Waves normally move in a straight line (that is, rectilinearly) through a transmission medium. Such media can be classified into one or more of the following categories:
A bounded medium if it is finite in extent, otherwise an unbounded medium
A linear medium if the amplitudes of different waves at any particular point in the medium can be added

This protein is member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family of proteins, a group of proteins that are thought to be involved in the development of the nervous system.
Gene
The NBPF1 gene in humans is located on the minus strand of 1p36.3 in humans and is 51179 base pairs long including exons and introns. It is located between the protein coding genes NECAP2 and CROCC. ","It is expressed at slightly lower levels in other tissues such as the pancreas, kidney, and lung. In the brain, NBPF1 expression is the highest in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, and it lowest in the ventricles and cerebellum. Based on protein composition, NBPF1 in humans and its orthologs in related species is most likely to be localized in the nucleus.
Predicted Localization of NBPF1 and its Orthologs
Expression studies have shown changes in NBPF1 under different experimental conditions in vitro. ","Like other NBPF proteins, the NBPF1 protein product contains a repeated domain called DUF1220, a domain of unknown function that is thought to be related to human brain complexity. First, NBPF1 is predicted to be a nuclear protein, as it contains positively charged nuclear localization signals. These nuclear localization signals in NBPF1 and a conserved DNA binding domain similar to the transcription factor STAT3/dna complex or STAT1/dna complex suggests that it could act as a transcription factor Second, genes like NBPF1 with DUF1220 genes are expressed during human neurogenesis.

This occurs when a bacterium swims by chance out of the area illuminated by the microscope. Entering darkness signals the cell to reverse flagella rotation direction and reenter the light. The second type of phototaxis is true phototaxis, which is a directed movement up a gradient to an increasing amount of light. This is analogous to positive chemotaxis except that the attractant is light rather than a chemical.
","Photokinesis is a light-induced change in the speed (but not direction) of movement. Photokinesis may be negative (light-induced reduction of motility) or positive (light-induced stimulation of motility). Photokinesis can cause cells to accumulate in regions of favorable illumination: they linger in such regions or accelerate out of regions of unfavorable illumination. Photokinesis has been documented in cyanobacteria and purple photosynthetic bacteria.
True phototaxis consists of directional movement which may be either towards a light source (positive phototaxis) or away from a light source (negative phototaxis). ","Phototaxis is a kind of taxis, or locomotory movement, that occurs when a whole organism moves towards or away from a stimulus of light. This is advantageous for phototrophic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for photosynthesis. Phototaxis is called positive if the movement is in the direction of increasing light intensity and negative if the direction is opposite.
Two types of positive phototaxis are observed in prokaryotes. The first is called scotophobotaxis (from the word ""scotophobia""), which is observed only under a microscope. "

This emission is a form of non-thermal emission called synchrotron emission.,The radio emission from supernova remnants originates from the fusion of hydrogen and helium in the core of the star. This emission is a form of non-thermal emission called synchrotron emission.,The radio emission from supernova remnants originates from the expansion of the shell of gas during the supernova explosion. This emission is a form of thermal emission called synchrotron emission.,The radio emission from supernova remnants originates from the ionized gas present in the remnants. This emission is a form of thermal emission called synchrotron emission.,B,A,"The fact that no further bursts were seen in 90 hours of additional observations implies that it was a singular event such as a supernova or merger of relativistic objects. It is suggested that hundreds of similar events could occur every day and if detected could serve as cosmological probes.
2010
In 2010 there was a report of 16 similar pulses, clearly of terrestrial origin, detected by the Parkes radio telescope and given the name perytons. ","However, the association of the burst with the afterglow was soon disputed, and by April 2016 it was established that the ""afterglow"" originated from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is powered by a supermassive black hole with dual jets blasting outward from the black hole. It was also noted that what was thought to be an afterglow did not fade away as would be expected, supporting the interpretation that it originated in the variable AGN and was not associated with the fast radio burst.
2017
","Although it was thousands of times less intrinsically bright than previously observed fast radio bursts, its comparative proximity rendered it the most powerful fast radio burst yet observed, reaching a peak flux of either a few thousand or several hundred thousand janskys, comparable to the brightness of the radio sources Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A at the same frequencies. This established magnetars as, at least, one ultimate source of fast radio bursts, although the exact cause remains unknown. Further studies support the notion that magnetars may be closely associated with FRBs. "
What is the piezoelectric strain coefficient for AT-cut quartz crystals?,d = 1.9·10‑12 m/V,d = 3.1·10‑12 m/V,d = 4.2·10‑12 m/V,d = 2.5·10‑12 m/V,d = 5.8·10‑12 m/V,B,D,"They combined their knowledge of pyroelectricity with their understanding of the underlying crystal structures that gave rise to pyroelectricity to predict crystal behavior, and demonstrated the effect using crystals of tourmaline, quartz, topaz, cane sugar, and Rochelle salt (sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate). Quartz and Rochelle salt exhibited the most piezoelectricity.
The Curies, however, did not predict the converse piezoelectric effect. The converse effect was mathematically deduced from fundamental thermodynamic principles by Gabriel Lippmann in 1881. ","The piezoelectric effect results from the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and electrical states in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. The piezoelectric effect is a reversible process: materials exhibiting the piezoelectric effect also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect, the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field. For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same crystals will change about 0.","There are no non-trivial rotation-invariant tensors that have this property, which is why there are no isotropic piezoelectric materials.
The strain-charge for a material of the 4mm (C4v) crystal class (such as a poled piezoelectric ceramic such as tetragonal PZT or BaTiO3) as well as the 6mm crystal class may also be written as (ANSI IEEE 176):
where the first equation represents the relationship for the converse piezoelectric effect and the latter for the direct piezoelectric effect.

There has been major corporate competition to lower the weight of racing bikes in order to be faster uphill and accelerating. The UCI sets a limit of 6.8 kg on the minimum weight of bicycles to be used in sanctioned races.
Advantages of reduced mass
For cycling on the level at a constant speed, a large weight reduction saves only a negligible amount of power and it is on the contrary beneficial to add mass in the form of aerodynamic improvements. But for climbing steeply, any weight reduction can be felt directly. E.g.","Alpe D'Huez = 8.6%

The list of proteins in the human body changes constantly.",D,B,"Proteins are essential nutrients for the human body. They are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source. As a fuel, proteins provide as much energy density as carbohydrates: 4 kcal (17 kJ) per gram; in contrast, lipids provide 9 kcal (37 kJ) per gram. The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition.
Proteins are polymer chains made of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. ","These six are arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, proline and tyrosine. Dietary sources of protein include meats, dairy products, fish, eggs, grains, legumes, nuts and edible insects.
Protein functions in human body
Protein is a nutrient needed by the human body for growth and maintenance. Aside from water, proteins are the most abundant kind of molecules in the body. Protein can be found in all cells of the body and is the major structural component of all cells in the body, especially muscle. This also includes body organs, hair and skin. ","Proteins are also used in membranes, such as glycoproteins. When broken down into amino acids, they are used as precursors to nucleic acid, co-enzymes, hormones, immune response, cellular repair, and other molecules essential for life. Additionally, protein is needed to form blood cells.
Sources
Protein occurs in a wide range of food. On a worldwide basis, plant protein foods contribute over 60% of the per capita supply of protein. In North America, animal-derived foods contribute about 70% of protein sources. "

The first measurement of the expansion of space came with Hubble's realization of the velocity vs. redshift relation. Most recently, by comparing the apparent brightness of distant standard candles to the redshift of their host galaxies, the expansion rate of the universe has been measured to be H0 = . ","In principle, the expansion of the universe could be measured by taking a standard ruler and measuring the distance between two cosmologically distant points, waiting a certain time, and then measuring the distance again, but in practice, standard rulers are not easy to find on cosmological scales and the timescales over which a measurable expansion would be visible are too great to be observable even by multiple generations of humans. The expansion of space is measured indirectly. The theory of relativity predicts phenomena associated with the expansion, notably the redshift-versus-distance relationship known as Hubble's Law; ","To determine the distance of distant objects, astronomers generally measure luminosity of standard candles, or the redshift factor 'z' of distant galaxies, and then convert these measurements into distances based on some particular model of spacetime, such as the Lambda-CDM model. It is, indeed, by making such observations that it was determined that there is no evidence for any 'slowing down' of the expansion in the current epoch.
Observational evidence
Theoretical cosmologists developing models of the universe have drawn upon a small number of reasonable assumptions in their work. "

As a result, the cryogenic systems that have to be developed correspond to two to four times the presently deployed systems and require increased availability and maximum energy efficiency. Any further improvements in cryogenics are expected to find wide applications in medical imaging techniques.
The cryogenic beam vacuum system for an energy-frontier hadron collider must absorb an energy of 50 W per meter at cryogenic temperatures. ","This follows the lessons learned from the history of the discovery and (by now) routine detection of the neutrino.
Experimental techniques
Cryogenic crystal detectors – A technique used by the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) detector at the Soudan Mine relies on multiple very cold germanium and silicon crystals. The crystals (each about the size of a hockey puck) are cooled to about 50 mK. A layer of metal (aluminium and tungsten) at the surfaces is used to detect a WIMP passing through the crystal. ","An ongoing R&D activity, carried out in close cooperation with the linear collider community, aims at raising the peak efficiency of klystrons from 65% to above 80%. Higher-temperature high-gradient Nb-Cu accelerating cavities and highly-efficient RF power sources could find numerous applications in other fields.
Cryogenics
Liquefaction of gas is a power-intensive operation of cryogenic technology. The future lepton and hadron colliders would make intensive use of low-temperature superconducting devices, operated at 4.5 K and 1."
"What was the purpose of Alexandra Dock railway station in Liverpool, England?","The station functioned as a maintenance facility for locomotives and train cars, offering repair services to the railway network.","The station served as a transportation hub for both passengers and cargo, operating until its closure on 26 February 1949.","The station primarily served as a cargo terminal, facilitating the transport of goods in and out of Alexandra Dock.","The station was a historical landmark, with no specific purpose related to transportation or cargo.","The station exclusively served as a passenger terminal, providing a convenient connection for individuals traveling to and from Alexandra Dock.",C,B,"In Victoria, there are sections of and dual gauge track between Southern Cross station and West Footscray, Sunshine and Newport, Albion and Jacana, North Geelong and Gheringhap, Maryborough and Dunolly, and in various goods yards and industrial sidings.

At Albury railway station, New South Wales there was and dual gauge line until 2011. There is dual gauge within Tocumwal railway station but in 1988, the standard gauge component was put out of use.
","Freight trains to the Port of Brisbane utilise the dual gauge Fisherman Islands line that runs parallel to the Cleveland railway line from Park Road to Lindum. Passenger trains utilise the dual gauge section of the Beenleigh railway line running parallel to the electric suburban narrow gauge of the Queensland Rail City network line over the Merivale Bridge into Platforms 2 and 3 at Roma Street Station. This is used by standard gauge interstate NSW TrainLink XPT services to Sydney. In 2012, a dual gauge line was installed between Acacia Ridge and Bromelton to serve a new freight hub at Bromelton.
","It also allowed standard gauge trains to reach the Elefsis shipyards. In Volos, a short section of track between the main station and the harbour used an unusual triple gauge, to accommodate standard gauge trains from Larissa, metre gauge trains from Kalambaka, and the gauge trains of the Pelion railway.

How is punctuation typically accessed in a multi-tap text entry system for mobile phones?,"Punctuation is accessed via the ""*"" key.","Punctuation is accessed via the ""1"" key.","Punctuation is accessed via the ""3"" key.","Punctuation is accessed via the ""#"" key.","Punctuation is accessed via the ""2"" key.",B,D,"Predictive text systems take time to learn to use well, and so generally, a device's system has user options to set up the choice of multi-tap or of any one of several schools of predictive text methods.
Background
Short message service (SMS) permits a mobile phone user to send text messages (also called messages, SMSes, texts, and txts) as a short message. The most common system of SMS text input is referred to as ""multi-tap"". Using multi-tap, a key is pressed multiple times to access the list of letters on that key. ","Predictive entry of text from a telephone keypad has been known at least since the 1970s (Smith and Goodwin, 1971). Predictive text was mainly used to look up names in directories over the phone, until mobile phone text messaging came into widespread use.
Example
On a typical phone keypad, if users wished to type the in a ""multi-tap"" keypad entry system, they would need to:
Press 8 (tuv) once to select t.
Press 4 (ghi) twice to select h.
Press 3 (def) twice to select e.
","Predictive text is an input technology used where one key or button represents many letters, such as on the numeric keypads of mobile phones and in accessibility technologies. Each key press results in a prediction rather than repeatedly sequencing through the same group of ""letters"" it represents, in the same, invariable order. Predictive text could allow for an entire word to be input by single keypress. Predictive text makes efficient use of fewer device keys to input writing into a text message, an e-mail, an address book, a calendar, and the like.

Which team conducted the first successful detection of the Erysipelotrichaceae family of Gram-positive bacteria?,The researchers at Stanford University in 2017,"The microbiologists at the University of California, San Francisco in 2015",The research group at Oxford University in 2020,None of the above,The scientists at Harvard University in 2018,E,D,"In 1885, the German-Austrian pediatrician Theodor Escherich discovered this organism in the feces of healthy individuals. He called it Bacterium coli commune because it is found in the colon. Early classifications of prokaryotes placed these in a handful of genera based on their shape and motility (at that time Ernst Haeckel's classification of bacteria in the kingdom Monera was in place).","The team called the computer ""ribocomputer"", as it was composed of ribonucleic acid. Meanwhile, Harvard researchers probed that is possible to store information in bacteria after successfully archiving images and movies in the DNA of living E. coli cells. In 2021, a team led by biophysicist Sangram Bagh realized a study with E. coli to solve 2 x 2 maze problems to probe the principle for distributed computing among cells.
History
","Bacterium coli was the type species of the now invalid genus Bacterium when it was revealed that the former type species (""Bacterium triloculare"") was missing. Following a revision of Bacterium, it was reclassified as Bacillus coli by Migula in 1895 and later reclassified in the newly created genus Escherichia, named after its original discoverer.
In 1996, the world's worst to date outbreak of E. coli food poisoning occurred in Wishaw, Scotland, killing 21 people. "
